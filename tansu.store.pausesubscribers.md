## Store.pauseSubscribers() method

Puts the store in the paused state, which means it will soon update its value.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
protected pauseSubscribers(): void;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

void

## Remarks

The paused state prevents derived stores (both direct and transitive) from recomputing their value using the current value of this store.

There are two ways to put a store back into its normal state: calling [set](./tansu.store.set.md) to set a new value or calling [resumeSubscribers](./tansu.store.resumesubscribers.md) to declare that finally the value does not need to be changed.

Note that a store should not stay in the paused state for a long time, and most of the time it is not needed to call pauseSubscribers or resumeSubscribers manually.
