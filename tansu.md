## tansu package

## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [DerivedStore](./tansu.derivedstore.md) |  |
|  [Store](./tansu.store.md) | Base class that can be extended to easily create a custom [Readable](./tansu.readable.md) store. |

## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [derived(stores, deriveFn, initialValue)](./tansu.derived.md) | A convenience function to create a new store with a state computed from the latest values of dependent stores. Each time the state of one of the dependent stores changes, a provided derive function is called to compute a new, derived state. |
|  [derived(stores, deriveFn, initialValue)](./tansu.derived_1.md) |  |
|  [get(store)](./tansu.get.md) | A utility function to get the current value from a given store. It works by subscribing to a store, capturing the value (synchronously) and unsubscribing just after. |
|  [readable(value, onUseFn)](./tansu.readable.md) | A convenience function to create [Readable](./tansu.readable.md) store instances. |
|  [writable(value, onUseFn)](./tansu.writable.md) | A convenience function to create [Writable](./tansu.writable.md) store instances. |

## Interfaces

|  Interface | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [OnUseArgument](./tansu.onuseargument.md) |  |
|  [Readable](./tansu.readable.md) | This interface augments the base [SubscribableStore](./tansu.subscribablestore.md) interface with the Angular-specific <code>OnDestroy</code> callback. The [Readable](./tansu.readable.md) stores can be registered in the Angular DI container and will automatically discard all the subscription when a given store is destroyed. |
|  [SubscribableStore](./tansu.subscribablestore.md) | Represents a store accepting registrations (subscribers) and "pushing" notifications on each and every store value change. |
|  [SubscriberObject](./tansu.subscriberobject.md) | A partial \[observer\](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-observable\#api) notified when a store value changes. A store will call the <code>next</code> method every time the store's state is changing. |
|  [UnsubscribeObject](./tansu.unsubscribeobject.md) | An object with the <code>unsubscribe</code> method. Subscribable stores might choose to return such object instead of directly returning [UnsubscribeFunction](./tansu.unsubscribefunction.md) from a subscription call. |
|  [Writable](./tansu.writable.md) | Builds on top of [Readable](./tansu.readable.md) and represents a store that can be manipulated from "outside": anyone with a reference to writable store can either update or completely replace state of a given store.
```typescript
// reset counter's store value to 0 by using the {@link Writable.set} method
counterStore.set(0);

// increment counter's store value by using the {@link Writable.update} method
counterStore.update(currentValue => currentValue + 1);
```
 |

## Variables

|  Variable | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [batch](./tansu.batch.md) | Batches multiple changes to stores while calling the provided function, preventing derived stores from updating until the function returns, to avoid unnecessary recomputations. If a store is updated multiple times in the provided function, listeners of that store will only be called once when the provided function returns. It is possible to have nested calls of batch, in which case only the first (outer) call has an effect, inner calls only call the provided function. |

## Type Aliases

|  Type Alias | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [Subscriber](./tansu.subscriber.md) | Expresses interest in store value changes over time. It can be either: - a callback function: [SubscriberFunction](./tansu.subscriberfunction.md)<!-- -->; - a partial observer: [SubscriberObject](./tansu.subscriberobject.md)<!-- -->. |
|  [SubscriberFunction](./tansu.subscriberfunction.md) | A callback invoked when a store value changes. It is called with the latest value of a given store. |
|  [UnsubscribeFunction](./tansu.unsubscribefunction.md) | A function to unsubscribe from value change notifications. |
|  [Unsubscriber](./tansu.unsubscriber.md) |  |
|  [Updater](./tansu.updater.md) | A function that can be used to update store's value. This function is called with the current value and should return new store value. |
