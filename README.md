# tansu

tansu is a lightweight, push-based state management library.
It borrows the ideas and APIs originally designed and implemented by [Svelte stores](https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0002-reactive-stores.md).

Main characteristics:
* small conceptual surface with expressive and very flexible API (functional and class-based);
* can be used to create "local" (module-level or component-level), collaborating stores;
* can handle both immutable and mutable data;
* results in compact code with the absolute minimum of boilerplate.

Implementation wise, it is a tiny (500 LOC) library without any external dependencies.

## Comparison with the Svelte stores

Tansu is designed to be and to remain fully compatible with Svelte. Nevertheless, it brings several improvements:

### tansu works well with the Angular ecosystem:
* works with the standard `async` pipe out of the box;
* stores can be registered in the DI container at any level (module or component injector).

### changes to stores are automatically batched

Depending on multiple stores can lead to some issues. Let's have a look at the following example:

```typescript
import {writable, derived} from 'svelte/store';

const firstName = writable('Arsène');
const lastName = writable('Lupin');
const fullName = derived([firstName, lastName], ([a, b]) => `${a} ${b}`);
fullName.subscribe((name) => console.log(name)); // logs any change to fullName
firstName.set('Sherlock');
lastName.set('Holmes');
console.log('Process end');
```

The output of this example will be:

```
Arsène Lupin
Sherlock Lupin
Sherlock Holmes
Process end
```

The fullName store successively went through different states, including an inconsistent one, as `Sherlock Lupin` does not exist! Even if it can be seen as just an intermediate state, it is **fundamental** for a state management to only manage consistent data in order to prevent issues and optimize the code.

In Tansu, subscribers are called asynchronously after changes to stores to defer the derived calculation and solve all kind of multiple dependencies issues.

The previous example is resolved this way:

```typescript
import {writable, derived} from '@amadeus-it-group/tansu';

const firstName = writable('Arsène');
const lastName = writable('Lupin');
const fullName = derived([firstName, lastName], ([a, b]) => `${a} ${b}`);
fullName.subscribe((name) => console.log(name)); // logs any change to fullName
firstName.set('Sherlock');
lastName.set('Holmes');
console.log('after set');
```
With the following output:

```
Arsène Lupin
after set
Sherlock Holmes
```

Note that the first call of a subscriber is always synchronous and always returns the correct up-to-date value:

```typescript
import {writable, derived} from '@amadeus-it-group/tansu';

const firstName = writable('Arsène');
const lastName = writable('Lupin');
const fullName = derived([firstName, lastName], ([a, b]) => `${a} ${b}`);
fullName.subscribe((name) => console.log("subscriber 1: " + name)); // logs any change to fullName
firstName.set('Sherlock');
lastName.set('Holmes');
fullName.subscribe((name) => console.log("subscriber 2: " + name)); // logs any change to fullName
console.log('after subscribe');
```

The output of this example will be:

```
subscriber 1: Arsène Lupin
subscriber 2: Sherlock Holmes
after subscribe
subscriber 1: Sherlock Holmes
```

## Installation

You can add tansu to your project by installing the `@amadeus-it-group/tansu` package using your favorite package manager, ex.:
* `yarn add @amadeus-it-group/tansu`
* `npm install @amadeus-it-group/tansu`

## Usage

Here is an example of an Angular component using a tansu store:

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { Store, derived } from "@amadeus-it-group/tansu";

// A store is a class extending Store from tansu
class CounterStore extends Store<number> {
  constructor() {
    super(0); // initialize store's value (state)
  }

  // implement state manipulation logic as regular methods
  increment() {
    // create new state based on the current state
    this.update(value => value + 1);
  }

  reset() {
    // replace the entire state with a new value
    this.set(0);
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: "my-app",
  template: `
    <button (click)="counter$.increment()">+</button> <br />

    <!-- store values can be displayed in a template with the standard async pipe -->
    Counter: {{ counter$ | async }} <br />
    Double counter: {{ doubleCounter$ | async }} <br />
  `
})
export class AppComponent {
  //  A store can be instantiated directly or registered in the DI container
  counter$ = new CounterStore();

  // One can easily created derived (computed) values by specifying dependant stores and a transformation function
  doubleCounter$ = derived(this.counter$, value => 2 * value);
}
```

While being fairly minimal, this example demonstrates most of the tansu APIs.

Check the [documentation](http://amadeusitgroup.github.io/tansu/) for the complete API and more usage examples.

## Credits and the prior art

* [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0002-reactive-stores.md) gets all the credit for the initial idea and the API design.
* [NgRx component stores](https://hackmd.io/zLKrFIadTMS2T6zCYGyHew?view) solve a similar problem with a different approach.
